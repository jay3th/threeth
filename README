Randomish collection of design stuff about binary and trinary computer
hardware design, mostly focused on multiple stack architectures.
trinary -> three, multiple stacks == forth, hench threeth.  Maybe some
crazy language design stuff too (forth + lisp + scheme + javascript +
smalltalk + c + joy = j3).

Every thing here is available with out notice under GPL 3.  Talk to me
if you want some other rights.
